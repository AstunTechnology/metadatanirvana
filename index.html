				<section>
					<p>Question: What is nirvana, from a metadata perspective?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Answer: The ability to create metadata that has <span class="fragment sentence">real business use</span>, <span class="fragment sentence">quickly</span> and <span class="fragment sentence">easily</span></p>
					<aside class="notes">What do we mean by "real business use"? If we know the provenance, scope, quality and history of the data we have a better idea of whether it's suitable for our needs. By recording the contact details, people can get it quickly and easily. This leads to increased business efficiency, less wasted time, and better sharing and discovery of data</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>In this webinar we'll look at the GeoNetwork metadata catalog and the new Gemini 2.3 metadata standard, to see how they might be harnessed to achieve all of this</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What we're covering:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment bold">A quick overview of GeoNetwork</li>
						<li class="fragment bold">An overview of Gemini 2.3 metadata standard</li>
						<li class="fragment bold">Additional features in the Gemini 2.3 plugin for GeoNetwork</li>
						<li class="fragment bold">Non-spatial Metadata in GeoNetwork</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>GeoNetwork Overview</h3>
					<p>GeoNetwork is the leading open source, standards-compliant metadata catalog, used globally for national and international spatial data infrastructures. It is run by a Project Steering Committee, comprising lead developers and users from around the world. </p>
					<img src="./images/geonetworklogo.png">
					</section>

				<section>
					<p>It's also an Open Source Geospatial Foundation project, which means it has passed a stringent incubation process focusing on code quality and sustainability. This in turn means it is reliable, has regular releases, and a strong support network.</p>
					<img src="./images/osgeologo.png">
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>GeoNetwork can be used for the creation and storage of both spatial and non-spatial metadata, and endpoints for sharing metadata in both human and machine-readable formats. It has a powerful interface for discovering and viewing metadata and data resources, and the creation, editing, and publication of metadata records.</p>
					<p class="fragment"><a target="_blank" href="https://geonet38.astuntechnology.com/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search">Let's take a look at the interface...</a></p>
					<aside class="notes">Login as guest user. Look at search menu. Choose Police Neighbourhood Boundaries. Add to map with "view" button</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Gemini 2.3 overview</h3>
					<p>Gemini 2.3 is the metadata standard for spatial metadata in the UK. It is compliant with international standards such as ISO19115 and INSPIRE. By using this standard for your metadata, you ensure the widest compatability for your metadata, and benefit from UK-specific guidance and support from the AGI Gemini Working Group.</p>
					<aside class="notes">Not just about publishing to data.gov.uk, but about ensuring interoperability with colleagues in other organisations or countries. Floods have no respect for boundaries on a map!</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Changes in Gemini 2.3</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment bold">New elements (some optional, some mandatory)</li>
						<li class="fragment bold">Some elements changing from optional to mandatory</li>
						<li class="fragment bold">Changes to the encoding for some elements</li>
						<li class="fragment bold">Renaming some elements</li>
						<li class="fragment bold">Guidance changes throughout</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">New mandatory- spatial representation type, file identifier, quality scope, new optional- parent identifier (datasets in series), prev optional- conformity, encoding - use and access constraints, renamed resource identifier, maintenance information</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>The Gemini 2.3 plugin incorporates the technical standard, validation rules, and guidance into GeoNetwork, along with a customised editing interface, and some helper functions to make metadata creation easier. It was built by Astun with support from the core GeoNetwork development team, and is publicly available on GitHub.</p>
					<img src="./images/metadata101.png">
					<aside class="notes">By building it as a separate plugin, records can be stored in different variants of ISO19139 or Gemini (2.2 or 2.3) and converted when ready</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Enhancements in the Gemini 2.3 plugin</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment bold">Better labelling and in-built guidance</li>
						<li class="fragment bold">"Suggestions" for quality as well as validity</li>
						<li class="fragment bold">"Inflate-Metadata" to ensure you don't miss or accidentally delete elements</li>
						<li class="fragment bold">New templates for datasets, series and services</li>
						<li class="fragment bold">Code snippets for contact details and conformity reports</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Boundary Line record, edit to show suggestions. Try deleting "Topic Categories" to show inflate. Show code snippets for contacts and conformity</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Non-spatial metadata</h3>
					<p>Gemini 2.3 is for <span class="fragment sentence">spatial</span> metadata, but you can store <span class="fragment sentence">non-spatial</span> metadata in GeoNetwork too. Working with DEFRA/EA, we've created a stripped down template to minimise the amount of data entry required, and configured an endpoint for publishing non-spatial metadata to data.gov.uk, so you can store all of your metadata in one location.</p>
